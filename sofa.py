# some thoughts on "moving sofa problem"

# 
# The main idea is to apply genetic programming.
# First I generate initial closed polygon contained within "corridor".
# The figure is small enough to be rotated.
# Then I succesively modify segments of polygon such that figure is getting bigger and bigger and still can be moved around. 


def move(polygon, x, y):
    return polygon

def rotate(polygon, x0, y0, alpha):
    return polygon
